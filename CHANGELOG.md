# Changelog

## v0.1.0

*Released 2026-11-01.*

First public release.

**keysink** — a tiny local gateway that keeps real API keys away from your agents: agents only hold revocable virtual keys (`ks_...`); real keys live encrypted in a local vault with no read channel, injected only when forwarding.

- Single static binary: Linux (amd64/arm64), macOS (amd64/arm64), Windows (amd64)
- Standalone mode (`keysink serve`); one-shot system install with `sudo keysink deploy` (systemd + sudoers) and symmetric `sudo keysink uninstall`
- age-encrypted vault, key zeroization, 0600/0700 + O_NOFOLLOW hardening (Unix)
- Per-route upstream proxy, SSE pass-through, retry/backoff, hot reload, async audit log

Download the archive for your platform, verify against the matching `.sha256`, put the binary on your `PATH`.
